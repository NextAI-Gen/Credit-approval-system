# 🎯 Submission Guide - Alemeno Backend Internship

## ✅ Pre-Submission Checklist

### 1. Test the Application Locally

Before submitting, ensure everything works:

```bash
# Start the application
docker-compose up --build

# Wait for all services to start (about 2-3 minutes)
# You should see: "Data ingestion completed successfully!"
```

### 2. Test All API Endpoints

Use the examples in `API_EXAMPLES.md` or test manually:

```bash
# Test 1: Register a customer
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first_name":"Test","last_name":"User","age":30,"monthly_income":50000,"phone_number":9876543210}'

# Test 2: Check existing data (from ingested files)
curl http://localhost:8000/view-loans/1
```

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
```

All tests should pass!

## 📦 GitHub Repository Setup

### Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd "F:\almeno assignment\68fa45db12c65_Backend_Internship_Assignment"

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Credit Approval System"
```

### Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (name: `alemeno-credit-approval-system` or similar)
3. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Copy the repository URL

### Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔍 Reviewer Quick Start

Add this section to your submission email:

```
**For Reviewers - Quick Start:**

1. Clone the repository
2. Run: docker-compose up --build
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for data ingestion
4. Test APIs at http://localhost:8000
5. See API_EXAMPLES.md for sample requests

All dependencies are containerized - no local setup required!
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Port 8000 already in use
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Windows
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process

# Or change port in docker-compose.yml
ports:
  - "8001:8000"  # Use 8001 instead
```

### Issue: Data ingestion fails
**Solution:**
- Ensure `customer_data.xlsx` and `loan_data.xlsx` are in the root directory
- Check Excel file columns match the expected format

### Issue: Docker build is slow
**Solution:**
- Normal on first build (5-10 minutes)
- Subsequent builds are much faster due to caching
